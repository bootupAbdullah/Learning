"user strict";

console.log("hello");
console.log("I am writing in Javascript");


//testing some scripts:
//<script> alert("Hey, this is Javascript! Look you\'re already doing it! :"))</script>
// TIL: you don't need the 'script' tag ie <script> on a seperate file that has been attached to the html through 'src='
alert("I'm JavaScript!")
