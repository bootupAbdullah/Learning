print(new_word[-1:0]) #! new print out
print(new_word[0]) #! that works, print out is "H" as expected. Now, we're getting some where.
print(new_word[-1]) #! that works too, prints out "o"
print(new_word[-1:]) #! again, prints out "o"
print(new_word[:-1]) #! everything but the last letter, so you get "Hell" ** I am not quite there yet (LOL)
