# Write your count_multi_char_x function here:

#   counter = 0
#   delimiter = []
#   for letters in word:
#     delimiter.append(x)
#     if delimiter in word:

# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(count_multi_char_x("mississippi", "iss"))
# should print 2
#print(count_multi_char_x("apple", "pp"))
# should print 1
