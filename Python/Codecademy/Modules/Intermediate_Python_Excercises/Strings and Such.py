'''This really stumped me because the 'print' is in the function, so the function's end is
to print response so I thought, it would print the word 'response' which I can see if flawed but the answers,
all had the word 'chocolate' in them and I thought the function call would not be able to to pull the word 'chocolate
because it's not in the function, and the 'print' is not in the function call, so I thought if this function is printed
it wold not be done so because of the function call, because the function call, althought has the word 'chocolate', it
doesn't or isn't being called to 'print' the function in the code, so the right answer of what the output would be
is: 'My favorite icecream ischocolate. Which makes sense, because there is no space in the string, inside the function,
between the 'is' and the quotation marks, but I just didn't think or know a function call can still work and print even
if the variable is coming after the function but the print is coming before the call, it's very tricky, 
and a good miss. '''
